Finding Roots of a Quadratic Equation in Java
In this Java program, we will find the roots of a quadratic equation [ax2 + bx + c]. We can solve a Quadratic Equation by finding its roots. Mainly roots of the quadratic equation are represented by a parabola in 3 different patterns like :

No Real Roots
One Real Root
Two Real Roots
Roots of a quadratic equation in java
Explanation
A quadratic equation is an equation of the second degree, meaning it contains at least one term that is squared.
The standard form is axÂ² + bx + c = 0 with a, b, and c being constants, or numerical coefficients, and x is an unknown variable.
One absolute rule is that the first constant "a" cannot be a zero.
Algorithm :
Calculate the determinant value (b*b)-(4*a*c).
If determinant is greater than 0 roots are [-b +squareroot(determinant)]/2*a and [-b -squareroot(determinant)]/2*a.
If determinant is equal to 0 root value is (-b+Math.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

        }
    }
 
    // Driver code
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
 
        int a = 1, b = 4, c = 4;
       
        // Function call
        findRoots(a, b, c);
    }
}
Output :
